# Linear-Regression-Project
This project focuses on applying **Linear Regression** to analyze customer behavior for an **Ecommerce company based in New York City**.
The company sells clothing online and also offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions.
Customers can visit the store for consultations, then purchase clothing later through the **mobile app** or **website**.

The goal of this project is to determine whether the company should focus more on improving its mobile app or website experience, based on customer usage data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains anonymized customer information related to their interactions with the ecommerce platform.
Each row represents a customer and includes metrics about time spent on different channels and purchase behavior.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key features and relationships
- Build a **Linear Regression** model to predict yearly spending based on user activity
- Determine which platform (mobile app or website) drives higher customer value
- Provide actionable insights for marketing and product strategy teams

  
## Dataset Fields (example columns)
- **Avg. Session Length:** Average session duration in minutes
- **Time on App:** Average time spent on the mobile app
- **Time on Website:** Average time spent on the website
- **Length of Membership:** Years as a customer
- **Yearly Amount Spent:** Annual spending in USD (target variable)
